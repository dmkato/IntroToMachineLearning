## HAC

1. The goal of clustering is to organize the data into subgroups such that all samples in a sub group are very similar to each other and very different from the examples in other sub groups.
    Some examples of clustering are product or movie suggestions, website categorization,

2. Single Link: Closest points in the clusters
   Complete Link: Furthest points in the clusters
   Average Link: Average distance between cluster pairs

3. Inverse of above

4. Single Link

5. The single link dendrogram is deeper than the complete ink dendrogram by 2 and the complete link is more balanced than the single link.
