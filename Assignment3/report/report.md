# Part 1
<!-- What is a good learning rate that works for this data and this network structure?
Present your plots for different choices of learning rates to help justify your final choice of the learning rate.
How do you decide when to stop training? Evaluate your final trained network on the testing data and report its accuracy. -->


# Part 2
<!-- What is a good learning rate that works for this data and this network structure?
Present your plots for different choices of learning rates to help justify your final choice of the learning rate.
How do you decide when to stop training? Evaluate your final trained network on the testing data and report its accuracy. -->

# Part 3
<!-- Please describe what you have tried for each of these parameters.
How do the choices influence the behavior of learning?
Does it change the convergence behavior of training?
How do they influence the testing performance?
Please provide a summary of the results and discuss the impact these parameters.
Note that your discussion/conclusion should be supported by experimental evidences like test accuracy, training loss curve, validation error curves etc -->

# Part 4
<!-- What do you observe in terms of training convergence behavior?
Do you find one structure to be easier to train than the other?
How about the final performance, which one gives you better testing performance?
Provide a discussion of the results.
Please provide necessary plots and figures to support your discussion. -->
